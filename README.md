# Say hello
季哥, 我是刘忠武, 好久未和您联系上了. 不知道您的 gmail 邮箱是否在用, 冒昧地以这个方式给你发消息. 您生活还挺好吧? 
看到您博客基本上不更新了, 但github还有动态, 看来您还是做技术相关工作, 我个人也一直沉迷于程序开发工作.  
我在github有个主页 <https://harryliu.github.io/about/>,  主要作为承接软件开发项目的case展现,  如果您那边有外包的项目, 可以发包给我. 
我常用的邮箱是: liuzhongwu2008@163.com, 微信号 harrychinese 
祝您全家顺利, 保持联系.  

# Learning Terraform
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Learning Terraform`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The code is built sequentally so each branch contains the completed code for that particular video and the starting code can be found in the previous video's branch.

The `main` branch contains the starting code for the course and the `final` branch contains the completed code.
